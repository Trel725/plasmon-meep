This is a simple script that tries to achieve variable resolution by coordinate stretching of the part of computational cell. This is very experimental code and results are unpredictable. Although general shape of spectra, produced by the script are more or less independent on the value of stretching, exact shape depends on stretching, which is unphysical.
